## Preprocessing

The purpose of the pre-processing phase is to prepare the X-ray images for classification using CNN pre-trained models. In this phase, different pre-processing steps are applied to improve the performance of the classification. The pre-processing steps can be summarized as follows:

| Classes         | Normal   |   Positive COVID-19 |   Viral pneumonia |   Lung opacity |
|-----------------|----------|---------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Number of cases | 10,192   |                3616 |              1345 |           6012 |
