## What are the symptoms?

Tumors can affect the brain by destroying normal tissue, compressing normal tissue, or increasing intracranial pressure. Symptoms vary depending on the tumor's type, size, and location in the brain (Fig. 2). General symptoms include:

- headaches that tend to worsen in the morning
- seizures
- stumbling, dizziness, difficulty walking
- speech problems (e.g., difficulty finding the right word)
- vision problems, abnormal eye movements
- weakness on one side of the body
- increased intracranial pressure, which causes drowsiness, headaches, nausea and vomiting, sluggish responses
