## Discussion

Distinguishing COVID-19 from normal and other classes is one of the important issues since the pandemic in 2019. The contribution of this research is to develop a framework to classify Coronavirus suspected cases as normal or COVID-19 positive cases. Different pre-processing steps have been applied to improve the performance of the classification. After that, multiplication between the original images and the associated lung masks has been applied to get the segmented lungs. The same process of multiplication has been applied between different enhanced image versions and the associated masks to get different enhanced versions of segmented datasets. All these versions are introduced to CNN models which are VGG19 and EfficientNetB0. Therefore, two different approaches have been used to train pre-trained CNN models using transfer learning. The first approach uses full chest X-ray images, while the other approach uses lung segmented images.

From the results of conducted experiments, it has been observed that the proposed framework has achieved a good performance using either full or segmented images, however the performance using full images is better than that using segmented. Moreover, it has been observed that the performance of the classification models has been improved after applying enhancement techniques.

To evaluate the proposed framework with respect to the state-of-the-art works in COVID-19, it has been compared with the related works reviewed in this research as described in Table 6. It is worth mentioning that, the comparison is not an easy task in COVID research as the pandemic broke out in the world suddenly, all Covid research used different sources of data either local, public, or combined from different databases. Some of the public datasets are collected from different other databases. Even the research that used the same public

picture_counter_16 The image shows a line graph titled "Training and Validation Losses". The x-axis is labeled "epoch" and the y-axis is labeled "Loss". Two lines are plotted: "train" in blue and "val_accuracy" in orange. The "train" loss starts high and decreases rapidly, while the "val_accuracy" fluctuates at a lower value.

datasets used different number of samples. Some research performed binary class classification, where others performed multi-class classification. Thus, the proposed work has been compared with others that used the same modality which is X-ray with mentioning the number of used samples and the task.

By comparing the results of the proposed framework with recent literature, it was found that the proposed framework outperforms most of the state-of-the-art works. However, 21 slightly outperforms the proposed framework. Where the accuracy and F1-score   of 21 are 96.71% and 97% respectively, the corresponding values of the proposed framework are 95% and 0.9505 respectively. Taking in consideration that   in 21 un-balanced data has been used; the number of COVID images used is 3626 where the number of normal images is 10,198 as mentioned in the manuscript.

For more validation, different classes of the datasets have been used for training the CNN models. To check the capability of the proposed framework for 4-classes classification. The dataset versions that achieved the highest binary classification have been utilized for multi-classes classification. Since the performance of all models that trained using enhanced full image versions is close to each other, therefore, these versions have been utilized for 4-classes classification. A set of 3200 X-ray images (800 of each class) have been used to train CNN models. The newly added classes are Viral Pneumonia and Lung Opacity in addition to COVID-19 and normal classes.

It was found that the best-achieved accuracy of 4-classes classification using the full image versions reached 0.935 for histeq version by EfficientNetB0. While it reached 0.93375 for both CLAHE, and complement versions using VGG19. Table 7 shows the results of the best-achieved models for 4-classes classification.
