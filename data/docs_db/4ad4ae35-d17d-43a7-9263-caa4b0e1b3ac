## Used datasets

In this research, the data obtained from the 'COVID-19 Radiography Database' has been used to apply the proposed framework. The database contains thousands of publicly available benchmark X-ray images and corresponding lung masks. The X-ray images are provided in Portable Network Graphics (PNG) format with a resolution of 299 × 299 pixels. The database includes 10,192 Normal cases, 3616 positive COVID-19 cases, 1345 Viral Pneumonia cases, and 6012 Lung Opacity images as shown in Table1. This database was developed by a team from Qatar University, Dhaka University, Bangladesh with cooperators from Malaysia and Pakistan and cooperators of medical   doctors 26 .
