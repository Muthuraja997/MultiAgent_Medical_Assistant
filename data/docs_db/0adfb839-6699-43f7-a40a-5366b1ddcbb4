## Limitation

With our motivation to investigate how it will work in single CNN and multilayer CNN based transfer learning models, we subjected the dataset to classification as it is without rotation and cropping operations, which is the most important limitation of our study.

Figure 5. The confusion metrics of ( a ) CNN model, ( b ) EfficientNetB4 model, ( c ) VGG19 model ( d ) InceptionV3 model, ( e ) VGG16.

picture_counter_5 The image contains five confusion matrices, each representing the performance of a different deep learning model in classifying brain tumors. The models are CNN, EfficientNetB4, VGG19, InceptionV3, and VGG16. The matrices show the counts of true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative predictions for four classes of brain tumors: glioma tumor, meningioma tumor, no tumor, and pituitary tumor. The matrices are heatmaps with color intensity indicating the number of predictions.
