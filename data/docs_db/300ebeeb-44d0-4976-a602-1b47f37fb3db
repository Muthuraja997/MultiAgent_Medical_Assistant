## Transfer learning

Transfer learning stands as a fundamental concept within both machine learning and deep learning, involving the utilization of knowledge garnered from training a model on a particular task and subsequently applying that knowledge to another related task. In the realm of neural networks, transfer learning manifests significant potency. It encompasses the process of employing a pre-trained model, typically trained on a comprehensive and varied dataset, and fine-tuning it on a fresh dataset or task 21-23 .

In this study, transfer learning models InceptionV3, VGG16, VGG19, and EfficientNetB4 were used in the classification process.
