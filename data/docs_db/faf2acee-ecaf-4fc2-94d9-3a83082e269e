## Types of brain tumors

There are over 120 different types of brain tumors. Common brain tumors include:

Gliomas

- Astrocytoma
- o Pilocytic Astrocytoma (grade I)
- o Diffuse Astrocytoma (grade II)
- o Anaplastic Astrocytoma (grade III)
- o Glioblastoma Multiforme (grade IV)
- Oligodendroglioma (grade II)
- o Anaplastic Oligodendroglioma (grade III)
- Ependymoma (grade II)
- o Anaplastic Ependymoma (grade III)

The World Health Organization (WHO) developed a classification and grading system to standardize communication, treatment planning, and predict outcomes for brain tumors. Tumors are classified by their cell type and grade by viewing the cells, usually taken during a biopsy, under a microscope.

- Cell type. Refers to the cell of origin of the tumor. For example, nerve cells (neurons) and support cells (glial and schwann cells) give rise to tumors. About half of all primary brain tumors grow from glial cells (gliomas). There are many types of gliomas because there are different kinds of glial cells.
- Grade . Refers to the way tumor cells look under the microscope and is an indication of aggressiveness (e.g., low grade means least aggressive and high grade means most aggressive) (Table 1). Tumors often have a mix of cell grades and can change as they grow. Differentiated and anaplastic are terms used to describe how similar or abnormal the tumor cells appear compared to normal cells.

Table 1. Glioma Grading Scale.

| Grade   | Characteristics                                                                                                                               |
|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| I       | Slow growing cells Almost normal appearance Least malignant Usually associated with long-term survival                                        |
| II      | Relatively slow growing cells Slightly abnormal appearance Can invade nearby tissue Sometimes recur as a higher grade                         |
| III     | Actively reproducing abnormal cells Abnormal appearance Infiltrate normal tissue Tend to recur, often as a higher grade                       |
| IV      | Rapidly reproducing abnormal cells Very abnormal appearance Area of dead cells (necrosis) in center Form new blood vessels to maintain growth |
