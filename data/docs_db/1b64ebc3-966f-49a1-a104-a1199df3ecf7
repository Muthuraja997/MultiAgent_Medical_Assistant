## Chemotherapy

Chemotherapy drugs work by interrupting cell division. However, it affects not only tumor cells but normal cells, thus causing side effects, especially in fast growing cells (e.g., hair, digestive, blood). Treatment is delivered in cycles with rest periods in between to allow the body to rebuild healthy cells. Chemotherapy drugs can be administered orally as a pill, intravenously (IV), or as a wafer placed surgically into the tumor. The drugs most commonly used to treat brain tumors are carmustine (BCNU), lomustine (CCNU), and temozolomide (Temodar). Chemotherapy is also used as a radio-sensitizing agent that increases tumor cell death during radiation therapy. Agents that often work in high-grade gliomas include procarbazine, platinum analogs (cisplatin, carboplatin), the nitrosureas (BCNU, CCNU), and alkylating agents (temozolomide, vincristine). BCNU has been proven effective when applied locally to the tumor bed after the tumor has been removed. By applying it directly to the diseased area of the brain, side effects are limited and the drug has a more beneficial effect. Chemotherapy is not routinely used for benign tumors.


## Adjunct therapies

- Immunotherapy or biotherapy activates the immune system (T-cells and antibodies) to destroy cancer cells. Experimental research is exploring ways to prevent or treat cancer through vaccines.
- Gene therapy uses viruses or other vectors to introduce new genetic material into tumor cells. This experimental therapy can cause tumor cells to die or increase their susceptibility to other cancer therapies.
- Hyperbaric oxygen uses oxygen at higher than normal levels to promote wound healing and help fight infection. It may also improve the tumor's responsiveness to radiation and is being studied experimentally. Currently it is being used to help the body naturally remove dead tumor cells and treat radiation necrosis.

Figure 5. The radiation beam is shaped to match the tumor and minimize exposure to normal brain tissue. The colored rings represent the radiation dose level.

A color-coded legend indicates the radiation dose in Gy (Gray) associated with each contour. The legend shows 9.00 Gy, 16.00 Gy, and 32.00 Gy. The image also shows that 100.0% equals 20.00 Gy.


## Clinical trials

Clinical trials are research studies in which new treatments-drugs, diagnostics, procedures, and other therapies-are tested in people to see if they are safe and effective. Research is always being conducted to improve the standard of medical care. Information about current clinical trials, including eligibility, protocol, and locations, are found on the Web. Studies can be sponsored by the National Institutes of Health (see clinicaltrials.gov) as well as private industry and pharmaceutical companies (see www.centerwatch.com).
