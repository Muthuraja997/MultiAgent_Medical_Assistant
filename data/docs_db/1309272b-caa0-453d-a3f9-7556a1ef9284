## Inception

The Inception architecture is an architecture used in the field of deep learning and CNN. It is designed to perform feature extraction and classification tasks more efficiently. First introduced in a paper titled "Going Deeper with Convolutions", the Inception architecture aims to provide better performance when processing complex visual datasets 25 . The Inception architecture has a structure that includes parallel convolution layers and combines the outputs of these layers. In this way, features of different sizes can be captured and processed   simultaneously 25 .
